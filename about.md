I'm Esther Ling, a graduate student at Georgia Tech in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I started out with a specialization in Systems & Controls, and then grew interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I've worked on natural language processing and interned at SF Express in Shenzhen as a Big Data Engineer where I developed a density estimation algorithm for predicting customer churn. Currently, I'm doing research under [Prof. Samuel Coogan](http://coogan.ece.gatech.edu/index.html), studying low-rank decomposition in signalized traffic dynamics. My combined exposure to controls and machine learning lends me a special affinity towards Robotics.

Before starting my Master's, I worked two years with The MathWorks' distributor in South-East Asia, where one of my major responsibilities was working with college seniors to improve engineering workflows. I created educational demos along the way, and published some of the work on a [MATLAB blog](https://dashboardproject.wordpress.com). This became unexpectedly popular, and I sought projects to explore that were not as widely covered online. One of my personal favourites was a demo on Parameter Estimation of a DC Motor, simply because it encapsulates the stages of modeling, control design and deployment in one example.

As an aside, I enjoy reading, as a form of picking other people's brains, or as a way to retire to a quiet spot for reflective thinking. In particular, I occasionally follow [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/), [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/) and [Shane Parrish](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com).
