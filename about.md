I'm Esther Ling, a graduate student at Georgia Tech in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My specialization is in Systems & Controls. Currently, I'm doing research under [Prof Samuel Coogan](http://coogan.ece.gatech.edu/index.html) in the area of predictive control of traffic networks. I also have a special affinity towards Machine Learning with Natural Language Processing, State Estimation of Power Systems, and Robotics.

I worked two years with senior college students with MATLAB and previously, blogged here on all things [MATLAB](https://dashboardproject.wordpress.com).

Also, I enjoy reading, as a form of picking other people's brains, or as a way to retire to a quiet spot for reflective thinking. In particular, I occasionally follow Cal Newport, Scott Young and Shane Parrish on their respective blogs.
