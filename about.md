I'm Esther Ling, a graduate student at Georgia Tech in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My specialization is in Systems & Controls. Currently, I'm doing research under [Prof Samuel Coogan](http://coogan.ece.gatech.edu/index.html) in the area of predictive control of traffic networks. I also have a special affinity towards Machine Learning with Natural Language Processing, State Estimation of Power Systems, and Robotics.

I worked two years with The MathWorks' customers in South-East Asia, where one of my major responsibilities was working with college seniors to improve engineering workflows. I created educational demos along the way, and published some of the work on a [MATLAB blog](https://dashboardproject.wordpress.com). One of my personal favourites was a demo on Parameter Estimation of a DC Motor, simply because it encapsulated correlated stages of modeling, control design and deployment in one example. I also presented a poster of this work as a Tech student at the 2016 Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting in Portland. I also worked with the Application Engineering team, where we built demos for the annual Thailand Automotive Seminar. I have experience with a hardware-in-the-loop model of a car engine, rapid prototyping with a physical throttle and power window, and LIDAR + webcam sensor fusion.

As an aside, I enjoy reading, as a form of picking other people's brains, or as a way to retire to a quiet spot for reflective thinking. In particular, I occasionally follow [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/), [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/) and [Shane Parrish](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com).
