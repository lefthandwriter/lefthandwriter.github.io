I enjoy keeping up with research in computer vision and deep learning. In particular, I'm interested in how Visual SLAM can be used in the context of self-driving cars, and if it makes sense to verify deep neural networks. Recently, I worked as a Software R&D intern at Panasonic Automotive, where I researched computer vision algorithms for object detection and 3D localization.

I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I did a Master's Thesis under [Dr. Samuel Coogan](http://coogan.ece.gatech.edu/index.html), studying low-rank decomposition for application in signalized traffic. This (to date) has resulted in a conference publication.

As an aside, I enjoy reading, as a form of picking other people's brains. In particular, I occasionally follow [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/), [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/) and [Shane Parrish](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com).
