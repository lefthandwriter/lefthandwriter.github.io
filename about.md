I'm Esther Ling, a graduate student at Georgia Tech in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My specializations are in Systems & Controls. I also have a special affinity for Natural Language Processing, Robotics and Power Systems.

Previously, I blogged here on all things [MATLAB](https://dashboardproject.wordpress.com).
