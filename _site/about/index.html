    <p>I’m Esther Ling, a graduate student at Georgia Tech in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I started out with a specialization in Systems &amp; Controls, and then grew interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I’ve worked on natural language processing and interned at SF Express in Shenzhen as a Big Data Engineer where I developed a density estimation algorithm for predicting customer churn. Currently, I’m doing research under <a href="http://coogan.ece.gatech.edu/index.html">Prof. Samuel Coogan</a>, studying low-rank decomposition in signalized traffic dynamics. My combined exposure to controls and machine learning lends me a special affinity towards Robotics.</p>

<p>Before starting my Master’s, I worked two years with The MathWorks’ distributor in South-East Asia, where one of my major responsibilities was working with college seniors to improve engineering workflows. I created educational demos along the way, and published some of the work on a <a href="https://dashboardproject.wordpress.com">MATLAB blog</a>. I sought to write on topics that were not as widely covered online, and this became unexpectedly popular. One of my personal favourites was a demo on Parameter Estimation of a DC Motor, simply because it encapsulates the stages of modeling, control design and deployment in one example.</p>

<p>As an aside, I enjoy reading, as a form of picking other people’s brains, or as a way to retire to a quiet spot for reflective thinking. In particular, I occasionally follow <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">Cal Newport</a>, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/">Scott Young</a> and <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com">Shane Parrish</a>.</p>
