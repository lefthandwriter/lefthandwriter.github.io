# Mandelbrot set

Using OpenGL and PThreads in C++, I drew the Mandelbrot Set, with a zoom + history feature and escape iteration of 8000.

# 2D DFT with MPI and PThreads

Given an input image, I computed the 2D DFT of the image by applying the Danielson–Lanczos approach for the one–dimensional transforms. Additionally, I implemented message-passing and pthreads to enable fast computation in a distributed computing environment.
