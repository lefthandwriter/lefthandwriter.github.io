# ChargePoint API & SQL Database Design
I wrote a script to pull data from the ChargePoint API, designed an SQL database using sqlite to store the data locally, and did an [exploratory analysis](https://github.com/lefthandwriter/ChargePointAPI/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploratory.ipynb) on the usage patterns. [Design notes](https://lefthandwriter.github.io/software/2018/06/22/Designing-EV-Database.html).

# Big Datasets
Master's Thesis - I worked with >135 GB traffic event data from Sensys Networks. This included designing an SQL database for the data, and using a REST API to get travel time data from Acyclica GO.

# Text Scraping and Analysis
I did [an analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lefthandwriter/DataIncProject/blob/master/Notebooks/Mercedes-Benz.ipynb) of Youtube Comments on Mercedez-Benz's Youtube channel. I additionally wrote Python scripts for scraping the comments using the Youtube API, available in this [repository](https://github.com/lefthandwriter/DataIncProject).

# R
Though I mainly work in Python for data science projects, I've had some experience with R, as shown in this [repository](https://github.com/lefthandwriter/R-programming).
