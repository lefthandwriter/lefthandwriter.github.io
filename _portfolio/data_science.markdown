# **ChargePoint API & SQL Database Design** [[Code]](https://github.com/lefthandwriter/ChargePointAPI)

- Wrote a script to pull data from the ChargePoint API

- Designed an SQL database using sqlite to store the data locally

- [[Exploratory analysis]](https://github.com/lefthandwriter/ChargePointAPI/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploratory.ipynb) on the usage patterns

- [[Design notes]](https://lefthandwriter.github.io/software/2018/06/22/Designing-EV-Database.html)
