I've worked with REST and SOAP based APIs, and designed databases using sqlite.

A few samples of my work:

# ChargePoint API & SQL Database Design
[ChargePoint API](https://lefthandwriter.github.io/software/2018/06/22/Designing-EV-Database.html)

# Big Datasets
Master's Thesis - I worked with >135 GB traffic event data from Sensys Networks.

# Text Scraping and Analysis
[An Analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lefthandwriter/DataIncProject/blob/master/Notebooks/Mercedes-Benz.ipynb) of Youtube Comments on Mercedez-Benz's channel. I additionally wrote Python scripts for scraping the comments using the Youtube API, available in this [repository](https://github.com/lefthandwriter/DataIncProject).
