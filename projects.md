## Classifying Quora Question-Pair Similarity 
###(Group Project, Georgia Tech)
Classifying if two questions are redundant plays an important role for websites that offer a question-answer service, such as Quora, Stack Exchange, Piazza, and general forums. Quoraâ€™s dataset, released January 25th, 2017, consists of binarily labelled question pairs, depending on whether they are effectively asking the same question. 

Question similarity classification is a problem of distinguishing semantic similarity between two short texts. Beginning with word embeddings ([word2vec by Mikolov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)), my tasks were to obtain sentence embeddings that would be representative of each question. I experimented with taking the sum of the word vectors, after scaling each word vector its with term frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf). I also augmented parts-of-speech tags and named-entity-recognition tags counts to the sentence vectors, generated from the [Stanford NLP toolkit](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/). Finally, I tried augmenting path similarity distance as measured by [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu) between groups of similar word types (noun-noun, verb-verb, adjective-adjective).

All code was done in Python for this project.
